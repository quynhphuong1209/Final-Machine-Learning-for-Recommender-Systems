## 📌 Objectives

- Understand and implement core algorithms used in recommender systems.
- Compare collaborative filtering, content-based, and hybrid approaches.
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics.

## 📊 Datasets

We use the **MovieLens 100K** dataset for experiments:

## 🧠 Methods Implemented

- ✅ User-Based Collaborative Filtering
- ✅ Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
- ✅ Matrix Factorization (SVD, SVD++)
- ✅ Content-Based Filtering
- ✅ Hybrid Recommendation Model (if applicable)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Precision@K, Recall@K
- Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
